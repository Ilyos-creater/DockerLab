# 🐳 Docker Learning Repository

Welcome to my official Docker repository!  
This repo documents my journey as I learn Docker — from basic containerization concepts to advanced use cases.

## 📘 Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to:
- Track my learning progress.
- Experiment with different Dockerfiles and setups.
- Build a solid foundation in containerization and DevOps.

## 📂 Structure

Each folder or file in this repo represents a separate project or experiment, such as:
- Simple container builds
- Multi-stage Dockerfiles
- Docker Compose setups
- Real-world mini projects

## 🚀 Future Goals

As I progress, I’ll expand this repo to include:
- Optimized Docker images
- Best practices for production environments
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines and Kubernetes

## 🧠 Learning Focus

- Docker CLI & Core Concepts  
- Image Building & Layer Optimization  
- Container Networking & Volumes  
- Compose & Orchestration
